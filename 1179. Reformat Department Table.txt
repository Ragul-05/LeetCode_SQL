Table: Department

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| revenue     | int     |
| month       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

Reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

Return the result table in any order.

Solutions:

select id, 
	sum(case when month = 'jan' then revenue else null end) as Jan_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'feb' then revenue else null end) as Feb_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'mar' then revenue else null end) as Mar_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'apr' then revenue else null end) as Apr_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'may' then revenue else null end) as May_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jun' then revenue else null end) as Jun_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jul' then revenue else null end) as Jul_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'aug' then revenue else null end) as Aug_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'sep' then revenue else null end) as Sep_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'oct' then revenue else null end) as Oct_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'nov' then revenue else null end) as Nov_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'dec' then revenue else null end) as Dec_Revenue
