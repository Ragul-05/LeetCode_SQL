(user_id, activity_date, activity_type) is the unique key for this table.
activity_type is one of ('free_trial', 'paid', 'cancelled').
activity_duration is the number of minutes the user spent on the platform that day.
Each row represents a user's activity on a specific date.
A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. Write a solution to:

Find users who converted from free trial to paid subscription
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

/*Using joins */
